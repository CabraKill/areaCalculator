# areaCalculator
A python program to calculate object area and dimensions with opencv.

### *Features:*

* Calculate object area

* Show its maximum dimensions
* Automatically calibrate the system by a reference area
* Create a 3d virtualization of the object
* create a cleaner image of a draw or object

### How came?

Working inside of an aero design team requires a lot of construction and its pos check routines. Dimensions, like many other variables, are really important to be check and its process may take more time than expected. Therefore, I made this python program to work with and accelerate the process.
